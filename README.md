# PDE-Localization

This work is from one my projects as a graduate student. 
Managing the complexity of this project was how I began to learn the art of software development.


The basic problem: minimize an enery function given as the integral of a PDE with boundary condtions over
the space of all finite collections of subsets in the 2D plane.
